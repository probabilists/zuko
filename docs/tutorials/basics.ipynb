    "\n",
    "When designing the distributions module, the PyTorch team decided that distributions and transformations should be lightweight objects that are used as part of computations but destroyed afterwards. Consequently, the [`Distribution`](torch.distributions.distribution.Distribution) and [`Transform`](torch.distributions.transforms.Transform) classes are not sub-classes of [`torch.nn.Module`](torch.nn.Module), which means that we cannot retrieve their parameters with [`.parameters()`](torch.nn.Module.parameters), send their internal tensor to GPU with [`.cuda()`](torch.nn.Module.cuda) or train them as regular neural networks. In addition, the concepts of conditional distribution and transformation, which are essential for probabilistic inference, are impossible to express with the current interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve these problems, [`zuko`](zuko) defines two concepts: the [`LazyDistribution`](zuko.lazy.LazyDistribution) and the [`LazyTransform`](zuko.lazy.LazyTransform), which are modules whose forward pass returns a distribution or transformation, respectively. These components hold the parameters of the distributions/transformations as well as the recipe to build them. This way, the actual distribution/transformation objects are lazily constructed and destroyed when necessary. Importantly, because the creation of the distribution/transformation object is delayed, an eventual condition can be easily taken into account. This design enables lazy distributions to act like distributions while retaining features inherent to modules, such as trainable parameters."
